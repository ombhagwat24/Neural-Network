# Neural Network
## 1.Problem Statment for gas turbine
The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine. 
The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.

### statement:
>predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.
## 2.Problem Statment for Forest Fire
PREDICT THE BURNED AREA OF FOREST FIRES WITH NEURAL NETWORKS
